The [`PerformanceObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceObserver) interface is a JavaScript API that can be used to observe the [Performance Timeline](https://www.w3.org/TR/performance-timeline-2/#dfn-performance-timeline) to be notified of new performance metrics as they are recorded.

This polyfill allows consumers to use the `PerformanceObserver` interface within browser environments, which have basic Performance Timeline support (I.e. `window.performance.getEntries()`), but don't have observer support. 

The polyfill works by falling back to polling the Performance Timeline on a given interval and calling all subscribed observers with the resulting set of entires.

## Installation
```sh
npm install --save @fastly/performance-observer-polyfill
```

## Usage: 

### As a [polyfill](https://ponyfill.com/#polyfill)
This automatically "installs" PerformanceObserverPolyfill as `window.PerformanceObserver()` if it detects PerformanceObserver isn't supported:

```js
import '@fastly/performance-observer-polyfill/polyfill'

// PerformanceObserver is now available globally!
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {});
observer.observe({entryTypes: ['resource']});
```

### Usage: As a [ponyfill](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ponyfill)

With a module bundler like [rollup](http://rollupjs.org) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org),
you can import `@fastly/performance-observer-polyfill` to use in your code without modifying any globals:

```js
// using JS Modules:
import PerformanceObserver from '@fastly/performance-observer-polyfill'

// or using CommonJS:
const PerformanceObserver = require('@fastly/performance-observer-polyfill')

// usage:
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {});
observer.observe({entryTypes: ['resource']})
```

## Caveats
As the polyfill implements the PerformanceObserver interface by falling back to polling the Performance Timeline via a call to `window.performance.getEntries()` we are limited to only expose timeline entry types that are supported by `getEntries()`. Therefore the polyfill can only be used to observe the entry types: `navigation`, `resource` and `mark`. Newer entry types such as `paint` are only exposed by the native PerformanceObserver implementation and thus not polyfillable. 

## Development

### Requirements
- Node.js >= 10a

### Install

git clone git@github.com:fastly/performance-observer-polyfill.git
cd performance-observer-polyfill
npm install
npm run build
```
